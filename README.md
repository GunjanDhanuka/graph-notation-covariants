Graph notation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein

## The mutations to be studied:

1. **Wuhan-Hu-1**: D614 + N501 + P681
2. **G-Strain**: G614 + N501 + P681
3. **N501Y-on-top**: G614 + Y501 + P681
4. **P681R-on-top**: G614 + N501 + R681
5. **501plus681**: G614 + Y501 + R681

## Things to keep in mind:
- Usually single mutations do not show a very significant impact, but in this case the mutations are heavy-weights and cause significant changes.
- Mutation `3` and `4` do NOT come together (Investigate this using graphs). In a few cases when they came together, they died out very quickly.
- Mutation `3` can be the Alpha, Beta or Gamma, or none of these.
- Mutation `4` can be the Delta, Deltaplus, or none of these.
